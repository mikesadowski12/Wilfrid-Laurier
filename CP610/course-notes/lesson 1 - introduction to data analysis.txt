WHAT IS DATA ANALYSIS?
  - Data analysis is inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making
  - data needs inspecting, cleansing, transforming
  - Before we start data analysis, remember the most important principle for data analysis: garbage in, garbage out

    Big data
    - Volume, Velocity, Variety, Variability, and Value
    - Because now we have much more technologies to collect data than before, we can consider big data as the statistical concept population
    - Big data analysis considers how to find the needle in the haystack
    - regular data analysis is based on samples from a population, and all the knowledge is about how to infer the real world via a small group of samples



WHY DATA ANALYSIS IS NEEDED?
  - If you have some assumptions, do a data analysis to convince other people or yourself that you are right.
  - Sometimes you don’t know how to solve an issue in your business or life, a data analysis can help you find the root cause
  - You need to predict what will happen (e.g., stock price or will this winter be significantly coder than before), previous data + machine learning can help



GAP BETWEEN GOALS AND DATA ANALYSIS
  - Having all the data in the world doesn’t mean you can make a correct decision
  - When you apply data analysis, you need to understand your proper goals and ask the correct questions first



TYPES OF DATA ANALYSIS
  Descriptive Analysis
    - describe some significant factors in complete data or a sample of summarized numerical data
    - how many concurrent sessions should be allowed for a website. If there are no more than 100 concurrent sessions in 99% of the time, then it is unnecessary to have a powerful server to support 1000 concurrent sessions

  Diagnostic Analysis
    - investigates the root cause of the insight found in statistics
    - useful to identify behavior patterns of data
    - figuring out why your revenue is getting worse. Unlike descriptive analysis, you want to dig deeper and find some patterns instead

  Predictive Analysis
    - tends to forecast the future
    - Once you figure out some patterns from diagnostic analysis, you can apply those patterns to new data to predict what is likely to happen
    - For example, you know the pattern of people who have a high probability of getting breast cancer, you can use this to predict whether a person is likely to have this disease
    - challenging because:
      - Patterns that happened in the past don’t necessarily repeat in the future
      - Patterns can be incomplete because the data we have diagnostic analysis on is biased
      - Not all patterns are useful

  Prescriptive Analysis
    - combines the insight from all previous analyses to decide which action to take in a current problem or decision



DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS
  Data Requirement Gathering
    - what data do you need
    - what metric you want to use, e.g., for predictive analysis, accuracy on the test dataset is a common metric
    - when you should stop, e.g., archive 99% accuracy on test data or find a property which matches 5 out of 10 requirements, etc

  Data Collection
    - it is helpful to keep records of data sources and all the updates

  Data Cleaning
    - when you get the data, it can have issues such as:
      - value missing
      - data duplications
      - outliers and errors
      - biased sampling
      - irrelevant information
    - This phase must be done before analysis because based on data cleaning, your output of analysis will be closer to your expected outcomes

  Data Analysis
    - As you manipulate data, you may find you have the necessary information you need, or you need to go back to the previous steps for a few iterations

  Data Interpretation
    - interpret your results and bind them with your goals
    - One problem is, not all results can be interpreted

  Data Visualization
    - often appears in the form of charts and graphs
