INTRODUCTION
  - data point or observation is a set of one or more measurements on a single member of the unit of observation”
  - data points are what we manipulate during data analysis
  - A dataset contains numbers of data points



INTRODUCTION TO PANDAS
  - Pandas can do:
    - Data cleansing
    - Data fill
    - Data normalization
    - Merges and joins
    - Statistical analysis
    - Loading and saving data
  - Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floating-point numbers, Python objects, etc.)
  - DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dict of Series objects



LOAD/SAVE DATA FROM CSV FILES
  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.read_csv("~/Documents/Data-Analysis/course-material/datasets/credit-screening/crx_data.csv", header=None)
  df.head(5)



GET THE SUMMARY OF THE RAW DATA
  - info() is a native method of a DataFrame object
  - value_counts() is also a very useful method to get the distinct value count of an object column
  - describe() method of a DataFrame object give you some extra information about numeric columns



ADD/DELETE COLUMNS/ROWS IN PANDAS DATAFRAME
  - drop() is the method to drop a column or a row
    - The argument axis is 1 when we want to drop a column and 0 for a row
    - To actually drop it, we need to use the argument “inplace=True”



GET/SET VALUE GIVEN A DATAFRAME LOCATION
  - iloc[] can be used to get values given row/column indices
  - iat[] which can locate the value we want as well as iloc[]. The main difference is the former doesn't support column names. It can only have integer indices for locating
