I believe the error shown above is a result of my windows account having a space in it (Mike Sadowski). I tried changing the account name, making a new windows account (doesn't work as it seems its caching that old username somewhere in the setup files, which I have tried to clear but to no avail), searching online and trying to edit the cross-site.xml file. Spent 2 days on this and its not working, handing it in as is. The rest of the setup was done correctly so this would work if it wasn't for this weird error.

### T3.2 Kmeans by Hadoop MapReduce

Complete? yes
