<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Sports betting has been a popular activity for many sports enthousiasts over the last few decades. It is a growing hobby that can garner people large amounts of money, or lead them into copious amounts of debt. Information technology and data analysis can provide a promising way for sport betters to gain an edge over the competition in predicting the outcome of sport matches.</p>
<p>The primary focus of this project is to analyze previous match outcomes for soccer teams competing in the English Premier League in order to provide a more accurate estimate of which team is going to beat the other. Team results (opposing team, score, goals for, goals against) will be analyzed over past seasons (primarily the 2018-2019 season) from a publicy available dataset from <code>data.world</code>.</p>
<p>Although the data set used in this project is from an older season, a more up to date dataset will provide better results for outcome prediction. In addition, using more than 1 dataset will also improve the accuracy of prediction (i.e. more than 1 season of results). For the sake of this project, only 1 dataset will be analyzed for simplicity.</p>
<p>Weka API is used as the main tool to evaluate the match outcomes and provide statistical analysis of the results.</p>
<h2 id="problem-solving-and-algorithms">Problem solving and algorithms</h2>
<ol class="incremental" type="1">
<li>Application data</li>
</ol>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>The dataset comes from reference [1]</li>
<li>Dataset contains 22 descriptive features and 381 match results (2018-2019 season)</li>
<li>The HomeTeam, AwayTeam, FTHG (full time home team goals), FTAG (full time away team goals) will be used for analysis</li>
<li>For example, Manchester United played Leicester City a total of 2 times, first score being 2-1 in favor of Manchester United, second score being 1-0 in favor of Manchester United. Analysis of these games shows that both times Manchester United came out on top with 3 goals for, 1 goal against, averaging 1.5 goals for in a game, and 0.5 goals against in a match against Leicester City. The prediction result would show Manchester United winning the next game against Leicester City for both home/away game with a probably score of 2-1 (rounded up).</li>
</ul>
<ol class="incremental" start="2" type="1">
<li>Models to represent information, knowledge and patterns.</li>
</ol>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>HomeTeam: represents the home team of the match (hosting away team in their stadium)</li>
<li>AwayTeam: represents the away team of the match (travelling to home team’s stadium)</li>
<li>FTHG (full time home team goals): represents the number of goals the home team scored</li>
<li>FTAG (full time away team goals): represents the number of goals the away team scored</li>
<li>AverageGoalsFor: number of goals scored, divided by total games played against that particular team (2 in a season)</li>
<li>AverageGoalsAgainst: number of goals conceded, divided by total games played against that particular team (2 in a season)</li>
<li>probableOutcome: computed winner based on the above statistics, along with approximate goals scored against the opposing team and approximate goals conceded against the opposing team</li>
</ul>
<ol class="incremental" start="3" type="1">
<li>Algorithms to solve the problems and compute the models.</li>
</ol>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Weka provides a vast set of classification algorithms, including many of the most popular. For this project, minimum, maximum, average (mean), and standard deviation will be used to analyze the results of all the matches.</li>
<li>Other possible methods of analysis that may be utilized also inlucde linear regression, KMeans, and/or decision trees</li>
